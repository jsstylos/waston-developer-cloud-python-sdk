## Installation

To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade watson-developer-cloud
```
or
```bash
$ easy_install --upgrade watson-developer-cloud
```

## Examples
The [examples](examples) folder has basic and advanced examples.

### Getting the Service Credentials
You will need the `username` and `password` credentials for each service these are *not* your Bluemix credentials, and are found in the VCAP_SERVICES variable on Bluemix, and they are different for each service.

You can use Bluemix to access your app and view the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable there.

Example output:
```
System-Provided:
  {
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "visual_recognition": [{
        "credentials": {
          "password": "<password>",
          "url": "<url>",
          "username": "<username>"
        },
      "label": "visual_recognition",
      "name": "visual-recognition-service",
      "plan": "free"
   }]
  }
  }
```

You need to copy `username` and `password`.

To build and test the project you need [pytest] and [responses].  
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
py.test test
```
## Python Version
